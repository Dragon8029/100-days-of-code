*Feb 4, 2019*

I am committing publicly to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. This will be attempt #5 for me. It's been a while since I've tried the challenge. I have had more success lately in alloting time to code, so here I go again. 
Worked through Radio Buttons, Select Boxes, and a Character Counter from Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery book.

Missed coding yesterday. Carried on today by finishing up the last chapter in Jon Duckett's Javascript & jQuery book. Most of the code is working, but there are a couple bugs to sort out. I will work on fixing them tomorrow.

Managed to fix most of the bugs in my code, but am currently stumped as to why the submit button is still working when I have added preventDefault() to my code. I even compared my code to the "follow along" code. Everything seems to match.

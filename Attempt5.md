I am committing publicly to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. This will be attempt #5 for me. It's been a while since I've tried the challenge. I have had more success lately in alloting time to code, so here I go again.

## D5:
*Feb 9, 2019*

Missed coding yesterday. Carried on today by finishing up the last chapter in Jon Duckett's Javascript & jQuery book. Most of the code is working, but there are a couple bugs to sort out. I will work on fixing them tomorrow. 

---

## D6: 
*Feb 10, 2019*

Managed to fix most of the bugs in my code, but am currently stumped as to why the submit button is still working when I have added preventDefault() to my code. I even compared my code to the "follow along" code. Everything seems to match. 

---

## D6: 
*Feb 11, 2019*

Still working on finding the bug in my code. I did managed to find and fix some typos, and I feel that I'm getting closer, but still no joy.
Oh well, tomorrow is another day. 

---

## D7:
*Feb 12, 2019*

Yay! I finally got all my bugs worked out. Slowly learning how to use the Chrome debugger. Finished up the final bit of code from Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery book. I am going to go back through the book to make sure I completly understand what the code is doing and the concepts.

---

## D20:
*Mar 6, 2019*

Decided to take a break from @freeCodeCamp for the evening as I received my Arduino starter kit from @elegoo. So I spent some time playing with that. It still involves code, so I'm counting it as a day.

*Mar 19, 2019*

Took a break from @freeCodeCamp, went back to a sign up page project I started a while ago. Researched how to submit the form data. I think I will go back to the Web Developer course by Colt Steele to refresh my memory of the server side handlling. 

---

## D31:

Went back to Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp. Trying to refresh my memory on Express, Mongo and Node.js 

---

## D32:
*Mar 21, 2019*

Forgot to tweet this yesterday. 
Still reveiwing Web Development Bootcamp. I forgot how in depth the course is. Hopefully soon, I will find what I need for my sign up page project soon. 

---

## D33:
*Mar 22, 2019*

Finally getting to the stuff I need to make my project work. This reveiw is good for me. I have forgotten a lot of things from the first time I went through the course. 

---

## D34:
*Mar 24, 2019*

Continued going through Web Development Bootcamp. Missed coding yesterday as I was travelling. Getting much closer to being able to add MongoDB to my app and be able to use it the way I want to. 

---

## D35:
*Mar 25, 2019*

Still working on finding the info I need from the Web Development Bootcamp course. But I am sure that I am getting closer. 

---

## D36:
*Mar 26, 2019*

Continued working through Web Development Bootcamp. I think I will need to continue to the end to find the info I need. Oh well, it's all good review. 

---

Missed a couple days, needed to give my brain a rest. And I had to go see the Iron Throne. Carried on today with Web Developer Bootcamp, I think I have found what I needed to make my project work. 

---

## D39:
*Apr 1, 2019*

Decided to dive into making my project app. Pretty much starting from scratch as my previous model wasn't going to work with my new approach. Managed to get all the packages installed and the basics added. It all connected properly when I ran node app.js. Feeling good about it so far. 

---

## D40:
*Apr 2, 2019*

Continued working on my project app. Still just adding some bare bones content, and trying to get everything set up. The routes aren't working yet, but I'm sure in the next day or two I should be able to get it sorted out. 

---

## D41: 
*Apr 3, 2019*

Still working on my project app, it's going to take a while. Managed to get one of the routes working and added some additional properties to the working schema. Feels pretty good to figure things out without using a tutorial. 

---

## D42:
*Apr 4, 2019*

Had some troubles getting the info from my form to populate in the database correctly. Managed to get it sorted out, and continued to build my app. 

---

## D43:
*Apr 6, 2019*

Worked on my project for a while. Having trouble getting the css file to connect inside my header.ejs file. Frustrated right now, I will come back to it after a break. 

---

## D44: 
*Apr 7, 2019*

Came back to my project refreshed this morning. Read some more about how to connect ejs files and got my directory path sorted out. Was able to start styling the tables. 

---

## D45:
*Apr 8, 2019*

Continued working on my project. Attempting to style an HTML table, and thinking that I may need to layout my project a little differently to work the way I want it to. 

---

## D46:
*Apr 9, 2019*

Still working on my project. Added some more form data and connected it to the database and table. Still have a long way to go, but liking the way it's working so far. 

---

## D47:
*Apr 10, 2019*

Changed the layout of the table, added a small if statement to handle a yes/no button. Didn't get as much done today due to family obligations. Still happy with what I did get done. 

---

## D48: 
*Apr 11, 2019*

A little frustrated with my code tonight. Nothing seems to be working. So instead of getting upset about it, I think I will stop, step away, and come back to it with a clear head tomorrow. 

---

## D49:
*Apr 12, 2019* 

Came back to my project with a clear mind. Things worked out today, I managed to solve my routing issue. Also started to populate the new route with the info I want to see. 

---

## D50:
*Apr 13, 2019*

Made some good progress today, managed to get all the info I need from the database to display correctly. Starting styling the details page. 

---

## D51:
*Apr 14, 2019*

Made a little progress today, got the navbar working properly, but discovered that the bootstrap css was overiding my stylesheet. Need to fix that next, that will be tomorrows project. 

---

## D52:
*Apr 15, 2019*

Got rid of the bootstrap styling for my project and built a css navbar. Will continue with more styling tomorrow, as i have run out of time for today. 

---

## D53: 
*Apr 16, 2019*

Continued styling the landing page and the form. I can tell I need to brush up on my css skills. I'm out of practice and it's taking longer than I thought it would to get some basic styling done. Oh well, it's all part of learning. 

---

## D54:
*Apr 18, 2019*

Missed coding yesterday due to family obligations. Got back to it today with some more CSS and styling the form for my project. I think it's come together nicely. I may come back to it to fix some small styling issues later, but for now I want to move on to styling my detail page.

---

## D55: 
*Apr 19, 2019*

Finished up styling all my route pages for now. Added sort functionality to my table so users can click on the table headers to sort info. The next step will be adding search functionality to the table. 

---

## D56:
*Apr 20, 2019*

Played around with trying to get my table to behave how I want it to. Found DataTables, which helped with getting the sorting feature added. Still having troubles with getting the search feature to work. I will try again tomorrow. 

---

## D57:
*Apr 21, 2019*

Managed to get the table to work how I want it to. It now has search function, and the sort works on all columns. Started to add some form validation, and researching how to add user authentication. It's been a productive day. :)

---

## D58:
*Apr 22, 2019*

Went back to Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele on @Udemy so that I could refresh my memory on User Authentication. It's going to take a day or two of review before I can attempt to add it to my app, but it's a start. 

---

## D59:
*Apr 23, 2019*

Continued reveiwing the User Authentication section from Web Developer Bootcamp. Didn't get anything added to my project, but I think I now know what I need to get User Auth working on it.

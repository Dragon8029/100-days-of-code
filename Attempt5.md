## D1:
*Feb 4, 2019*

I am committing publicly to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. This will be attempt #5 for me. It's been a while since I've tried the challenge. I have had more success lately in alloting time to code, so here I go again. 
Worked through Radio Buttons, Select Boxes, and a Character Counter from Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery book. 

---

## D2/3:
*Feb 5, 2019*

Worked my way through HTML5 Elements & Attributes through to Conditional Loading of a Polyfill in Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery book. Also started working through the Validation section which is the last section in the book. 

---

## D4:
*Feb 7, 2019* 

Continued working through the Validation section of the Javascript & jQuery book. Added the basic script set up, some validation checks and some required functions. 

---

## D5:
*Feb 9, 2019*

Missed coding yesterday. Carried on today by finishing up the last chapter in Jon Duckett's Javascript & jQuery book. Most of the code is working, but there are a couple bugs to sort out. I will work on fixing them tomorrow. 

---

## D6: 
*Feb 10, 2019*

Managed to fix most of the bugs in my code, but am currently stumped as to why the submit button is still working when I have added preventDefault() to my code. I even compared my code to the "follow along" code. Everything seems to match. 

---

## D6: 
*Feb 11, 2019*

Still working on finding the bug in my code. I did managed to find and fix some typos, and I feel that I'm getting closer, but still no joy.
Oh well, tomorrow is another day. 

---

## D7:
*Feb 12, 2019*

Yay! I finally got all my bugs worked out. Slowly learning how to use the Chrome debugger. Finished up the final bit of code from Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery book. I am going to go back through the book to make sure I completly understand what the code is doing and the concepts. 

---

## D8: 
*Feb 13, 2019*

Worked through some reg ex on @FreeCodeCamp.

Finished up the Basic Data Structure Challenges section from @freeCodeCamp, and started the Basic Algorithm Scripting section. 

---

## D16:
*Feb 27, 2019*

Made my way through a couple Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges from @freeCodeCamp. Will keep progressing tomorrow...

---

## D17: 
*Mar 2, 2019*

Continued working on Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges from @freeCodeCamp. Ran into a small problem where all the test pass, except for one with negative numbers.... Time to do some more reading. 

---

## D18: 
*Mar 3, 2019*

Made my way through a couple more Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges from @freeCodeCamp. 

---

## D19: 
*Mar 4, 2019* 

Carried on through a couple more Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges from @freeCodeCamp. Progress has been much slower than before, but the challenges are forcing me to think and research each problem. I like it!

---

## D20:
*Mar 6, 2019*

Decided to take a break from @freeCodeCamp for the evening as I received my Arduino starter kit from @elegoo. So I spent some time playing with that. It still involves code, so I'm counting it as a day. 

---

## D21: 
*Mar 8, 2019*

Worked on my Arduino kit some more. This is a lot of fun. Made it up to lesson 10 on using the ultrasonic sensor. 

---

## D22:
*Mar 9, 2019*

Finished up the Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges from @freeCodeCamp, will be starting the Object Oriented Programming Challenges tomorrow. Also played around with my new Arduino kit from @elegoo, loving it so far. 

---

## D23:
*Mar 10, 2019*

Started making my way through the Object Oriented Programming Challenges from @freeCodeCamp. 

---

## D24: 
*Mar 11, 2019* 

Continued working through the Object Oriented Programming Challengs from @freeCodeCamp

---

## D25:
*Mar 12, 2019*

Made my way through several more Object Oriented Programming Challenges from @freeCodeCamp. Not getting as much time to code as I would like, but at least I can get some time in.

---

## D26:
*Mar 14, 2019*

Finished up the Object Oriented Progamming Challenges from @freeCodeCamp, now to move onto the Functional Programming Challenges. 

---

## D27:
*Mar 16, 2019*

Made my way through several Functional Programming Challenges from @freeCodeCamp. Things are getting tougher, but also starting to make a little more sense. 

---

## D28:
*Mar 17, 2019*

Worked through a couple more Functional Programming Challenges from @freeCodeCamp. 

---

## D29:
*Mar 18, 2019*

---

## D30:
*Mar 19, 2019*

Took a break from @freeCodeCamp, went back to a sign up page project I started a while ago. Researched how to submit the form data. I think I will go back to the Web Developer course by Colt Steele to refresh my memory of the server side handlling. 

---

## D31:
*Mar 20, 2019*

Went back to Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp. Trying to refresh my memory on Express, Mongo and Node.js 

---

## D32:
*Mar 21, 2019*

Forgot to tweet this yesterday. 
Still reveiwing Web Development Bootcamp. I forgot how in depth the course is. Hopefully soon, I will find what I need for my sign up page project soon.

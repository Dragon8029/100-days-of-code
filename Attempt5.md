I am committing publicly to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. This will be attempt #5 for me. It's been a while since I've tried the challenge. I have had more success lately in alloting time to code, so here I go again.

Missed coding yesterday. Carried on today by finishing up the last chapter in Jon Duckett's Javascript & jQuery book. Most of the code is working, but there are a couple bugs to sort out. I will work on fixing them tomorrow.

Managed to fix most of the bugs in my code, but am currently stumped as to why the submit button is still working when I have added preventDefault() to my code. I even compared my code to the "follow along" code. Everything seems to match.

Still working on finding the bug in my code. I did managed to find and fix some typos, and I feel that I'm getting closer, but still no joy.
Oh well, tomorrow is another day.

Yay! I finally got all my bugs worked out. Slowly learning how to use the Chrome debugger. Finished up the final bit of code from Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery book. I am going to go back through the book to make sure I completly understand what the code is doing and the concepts.

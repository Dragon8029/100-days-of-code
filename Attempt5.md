*Feb 4, 2019*

I am committing publicly to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. This will be attempt #5 for me. It's been a while since I've tried the challenge. I have had more success lately in alloting time to code, so here I go again. 
Worked through Radio Buttons, Select Boxes, and a Character Counter from Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery book.

Worked my way through HTML5 Elements & Attributes through to Conditional Loading of a Polyfill in Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery book. Also started working through the Validation section which is the last section in the book.

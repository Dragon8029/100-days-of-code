I am committing publicly to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. This will be attempt #6 for me. After 2 months of being unable to code for medical reasons, I am finally able to code again and really want to complete this challenge. 

Needed to get back to the basics, so I decided I will start with Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS book. Managed to get part way through Chapter 2 before I stopped for today.  Feels good to be able to sit down and write code again.

Made my way through the rest of chapter 2 and completed chapter 3 of Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS book. It covered semantic markup and lists. I learned some new things that I haven't come accross before, like abbreviations, citations and definitions tags. Also the definitions list is a new one I found today.

*July 29, 2019*

I am committing publicly to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. This will be attempt #6 for me. After 2 months of being unable to code for medical reasons, I am finally able to code again and really want to complete this challenge. 

Needed to get back to the basics, so I decided I will start with Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS book. Managed to get part way through Chapter 2 before I stopped for today.  Feels good to be able to sit down and write code again.

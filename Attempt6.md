## D1/100:
*July 29, 2019*

I am committing publicly to the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. This will be attempt #6 for me. After 2 months of being unable to code for medical reasons, I am finally able to code again and really want to complete this challenge. 

Needed to get back to the basics, so I decided I will start with Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS book. Managed to get part way through Chapter 2 before I stopped for today.  Feels good to be able to sit down and write code again.

Made my way through the rest of chapter 2 and completed chapter 3 of Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS book. It covered semantic markup and lists.

---

Received the second weekly project in my inbox. Didn't get any coding done, but started to plan out how I want to tackle this one. 

---

## D48/100:
*Sep 20, 2019*

I didn't count the last couple days due to not really having my head into coding. I took 1 day away from my computer completly. Feeling much better today. Continued working on the week 2 project. Struggling a bit with how I want things to work, but it's a good way to challenge myself. 

---

## D49/100:

## D54/100:
*Sep 29, 2019*

Started a fullstack React course from Udemy. Didn't get to the coding part, as getting everything set up and installed took a while. 

---

## D55/100:
*Sep 30, 2019* 

Continued on with the React course. It's slow going right now, but I'm sure it will pick up soon. 

---

## D56/100:
*Oct 1, 2019*

Continued working through the Udemy React course. Didn't find as much time as I would have liked, but some progress is better than none. 

---

## D57/100: 
*Oct 2, 2019*

Continued following along with the Udemy React course. 

---

## D58/100:
*Oct 3, 2019*

Carried on working through the Udemy React course. I'm finding it difficult to concentrate on it currently. And the instructor likes to jump around, and is not clear on what he is doing all the time. 

---

## D59/100: 
*Oct 4, 2019*

Continued working through the React course. I've also been learning how to do pull requests in git and github. 

---

## D60/100:
*Oct 5, 2019*

Carried on working through the React course. 

---

## D61/100:
*Oct 6, 2019*

Still working through the React course. 

---

## D62/100:
*Oct 7, 2019*

I think today is the last day I will attempt this React course. It's been really hard to follow, and I think I need to up my Javascript skills before I attempt anything to do with react. 

---

## D63/100:
*Oct 8, 2019*

Decided to stop working on the React course. It was confusing me, and the instructor wasn't clear enough. I decided to go back to working on my sign up app project that I started a long time ago. It will take a bit of time to get back into the swing of things. But I still want to complete it. 

---

## D64/100:
*Oct 9, 2019*

Didn't write any actual code today, but did refresh my memory on how I want the sign up app project to look like and work. 

---

## D65/100:
*Oct 10, 2019*

Cleaned up some code and got familiar with how my code is layed out. Still have a long ways to go before it will be a working app.

---

## D66/100:
*Oct 11, 2019*

Worked on adding files and content to the json movie collection. 

---

## D67/100:
*Oct 12, 2019*

Started trying to get the visitor sign in page to show on my sign in app. Also still trying to come up with a better name for it than Digital Operations Management. 

---

## D68/100:
*Oct 13, 2019*

Continued working on my D.O.M. app, got it deployed on heroku, and connected to my github. I need to get the sign out button working properly, and I think I would like to have the name disappear from the list. And maybe redirect to a thank you page. 

---

## D69/100:
*Oct 14, 2019*

Continued working on my app, ran into some problems getting a feature to work. Ended up doing some reading on express, still haven't figured out what I'm doing, but I'm getting closer. 

---

## D70/100:
*Oct 15, 2019*

Still reading and researching how to get my feature to work. It's going to take longer than I expected I fear. Oh well, that's life. 

---

## D71/100:
*Oct 16, 2019*

Not feeling overly productive lately, but I am still researching node.js and express to try and figure out how to get the feature I want to work in my project. 

---

## D72/100:
*Oct 17, 2019*

Still trying to research a solution to my timestamp issue. I haven't been making a lot of headway and am currently feeling a little frustrated with it. I think I will take a days break and then come back to it. 

---

## D73/100:
*Oct 19, 2019*

Worked on several possible solutions for being able to hide a button. Didn't get them to work, but will keep trying as I have time.

 100 Days of Code - Log
 
 Day 1: December 23, 2017
 
 Today's Progress: Completed freeCodeCamp's front end basic JavaScript challenges. Started the Object Oriented and Functional Programming section. 
         
 Thoughts: Will need more practice, and more resources for learning JavaScript. Having troubles understanding nested loops.

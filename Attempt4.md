*July 14, 2018*

After some time off due to some medical issues, I am back. This will be attempt #4 at the 100 Days of Code Challenge. Today I worked on trying to debug the "Asteroids" game I had trouble with prior to stopping attempt #3.

Managed to debug "Asteroids" game, one letter was missing, so frustrating. Carried on and now have added lives, and levels to the game.

##A4D3:
*July 17, 2018*

Finished up working on the "Asteroids in JavaScript" game tutorial. It was fun to build and really enjoyed utilizing JavaScript this way. It helps to understand some of the concepts I have been learning.

##A4D4:
*July 18, 2018* 

Started on the "Product Landing Page" for the responsive web design projects from @FreeCodeCamp, managed to get a good start on my layout. 

---

##A4D5:
*July 26, 2018*

After some setbacks with trying to code everyday, I have come to terms that my life just will not allow me to code everyday. I'm ok with it, and will not stop working towards my goal of being a professional developer. Continued working on the @freeCodeCamp "Product Landing Page" project. 

---

##A4D6:
*July 27, 2018*

Decided to take a little break from the "Product Landing Page" and started working on a "Snake" game from a tutorial I found. Should be fun!

---

##A4D7:
*July 28, 2018*

Finished up the "Snake" game, it was a fun little build, but I think I want to add a high score function to it. I will have to reveiw the "Asteroids" game in order remember how to build that function. I think it will improve the game a bit.

##A4D8:
*July 29, 2018*

Managed to get a high score function added into the "Snake" game. Continued working on "Product Landing Page" for @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects.

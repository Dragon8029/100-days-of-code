After some time off due to some medical issues, I am back. This will be attempt #4 at the 100 Days of Code Challenge. Today I worked on trying to debug the "Asteroids" game I had trouble with prior to stopping attempt #3.

Managed to debug "Asteroids" game, one letter was missing, so frustrating. Carried on and now have added lives, and levels to the game.

Finished up working on the "Asteroids in JavaScript" game tutorial. It was fun to build and really enjoyed utilizing JavaScript this way. It helps to understand some of the concepts I have been learning.

Started on the "Product Landing Page" for the responsive web design projects from @FreeCodeCamp, managed to get a good start on my layout.

After some setbacks with trying to code everyday, I have come to terms that my life just will not allow me to code everyday. I'm ok with it, and will not stop working towards my goal of being a professional developer. Continued working on the @freeCodeCamp "Product Landing Page" project.

Decided to take a little break from the "Product Landing Page" and started working on a "Snake" game from a tutorial I found. Should be fun!

Finished up the "Snake" game, it was a fun little build, but I think I want to add a high score function to it. I will have to reveiw the "Asteroids" game in order remember how to build that function. I think it will improve the game a bit.

After another break due to my paying job keeping me from coding. I continued working on "Product Landing Page" for @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects. Finished up the basic HTML, and started adding some of the CSS.

Continued working on the product landing page project from @freeCodeCamp. It's taking longer than expected. I needed this to come back to and remember CSS.

Still working on the product landing page project from @freeCodeCamp. Some CSS is holding me up. I will get it, just strugling to make it work the way I want it to.

*Aug 14, 2018*

Managed to make some progress on the product landing page projects. Was having a tough time getting my li's to arrange horizontally instead of vertically. Now I can start working on the rest of the page.

*Aug 15, 2018*

Continued working on the styling for the product landing page. Also worked on some git and github tutorials. Today is a travel day on my vacation, so not a whole bunch of coding getting done. 

##A4D14:
*Aug 16, 2018*

Finished working on the git and github tutorials. Now I just need to make sure I use them more to get comfortable with them, especially the command line. Also worked on the product landing page projects a little.

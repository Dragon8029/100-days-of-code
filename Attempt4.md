*July 14, 2018*

After some time off due to some medical issues, I am back. This will be attempt #4 at the 100 Days of Code Challenge. Today I worked on trying to debug the "Asteroids" game I had trouble with prior to stopping attempt #3.

Managed to debug "Asteroids" game, one letter was missing, so frustrating. Carried on and now have added lives, and levels to the game.

*July 17, 2018*

Finished up working on the "Asteroids in JavaScript" game tutorial. It was fun to build and really enjoyed utilizing JavaScript this way. It helps to understand some of the concepts I have been learning.

Started on the "Product Landing Page" for the responsive web design projects from @FreeCodeCamp, managed to get a good start on my layout.

*July 26, 2018*

After some setbacks with trying to code everyday, I have come to terms that my life just will not allow me to code everyday. I'm ok with it, and will not stop working towards my goal of being a professional developer. Continued working on the @freeCodeCamp "Product Landing Page" project.

##A4D6:
*July 27, 2018*

Decided to take a little break from the "Product Landing Page" and started working on a "Snake" game from a tutorial I found. Should be fun!

*July 28, 2018*

Finished up the "Snake" game, it was a fun little build, but I think I want to add a high score function to it. I will have to reveiw the "Asteroids" game in order remember how to build that function. I think it will improve the game a bit.

After another break due to my paying job keeping me from coding. I continued working on "Product Landing Page" for @freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects. Finished up the basic HTML, and started adding some of the CSS.

##A4D10:
*Aug 12, 2018*

Continued working on the product landing page project from @freeCodeCamp. It's taking longer than expected. I needed this to come back to and remember CSS.

##A4D11:
*Aug 13, 2018*

Still working on the product landing page project from @freeCodeCamp. Some CSS is holding me up. I will get it, just strugling to make it work the way I want it to.

##A4D12:
*Aug 14, 2018*

Managed to make some progress on the product landing page projects. Was having a tough time getting my li's to arrange horizontally instead of vertically. Now I can start working on the rest of the page.

##A4D13:
*Aug 15, 2018*

Continued working on the styling for the product landing page. Also worked on some git and github tutorials. Today is a travel day on my vacation, so not a whole bunch of coding getting done. 

##A4D14:
*Aug 16, 2018*

Finished working on the git and github tutorials. Now I just need to make sure I use them more to get comfortable with them, especially the command line. Also worked on the product landing page projects a little. 

---

##A4D15:
*Aug 17, 2018*

Continued working on the product landing page from @freeCodeCamp. Having some issues with CSS, it seems like it want's to work against me instead of with me. LOL! Oh well, it's all a part of the learning process.

Getting closer to finishing up the landing page project from @freeCodeCamp. This has been a good refresher on CSS as I hadn't used it for some time as I was focused on trying to learn JavaScript.

After some time off due to some medical issues, I am back. This will be attempt #4 at the 100 Days of Code Challenge. Today I worked on trying to debug the "Asteroids" game I had trouble with prior to stopping attempt #3.

Managed to debug "Asteroids" game, one letter was missing, so frustrating. Carried on and now have added lives, and levels to the game.

Finished up working on the "Asteroids in JavaScript" game tutorial. It was fun to build and really enjoyed utilizing JavaScript this way. It helps to understand some of the concepts I have been learning.
